            <h1> What Is a Front-End  Developer?</h1>
                <p>
                    Front-end web development,also known as client-side development is the practice of producing <b> HTML, CSS</b> and <b> JavaScript</b> for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
                    <br><br> The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers <b> (cross-browser)</b> , different operating systems <b> (cross-platform)</b> and different devices <b> (cross-device)</b> , which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.
                </p>

                    - Hypertext Markup Language is the core of a website, providing the overall design and functionality. <br><br>
                    - The most recent version was released in late 2017 and is known as <b>HTML5.2</b> . <br><br>
                    - The updated version includes more tools aimed at web application developers as well as adjustments made to improve interoperability. <br><br>

                    - This event-based language is useful for creating dynamic elements on static <b>HTML</b> web pages. <br><br>
                    - It allows developers to access elements separate from the main <b>HTML</b> page, as well as respond to <b> server-side</b> events. <br><br>

            <h1> WHAT Is Back-End Developer?</h1>
                <p>
                    A back-end developer is someone who builds and maintains the technology needed to power the components which enable the user-facing side of the website to exist. Their back end code adds utility to everything the front-end developer creates.
                    <br><br>These developers are responsible for creating, maintaining, testing, and debugging the entire back end. This includes the core application logic, databases, data and application integration, <b>API</b> and other back end processes.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="part">
            <h1> <> Back-end Tools <></h1>
                <p>
                    The core concern of back-end developers is creating applications that can find and deliver data to the front end.<br><br>
                    Many of them use reliable enterprise-level databases like <b>Oracle</b>, <b>Teradata</b>, <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b>, <b>IBM DB2</b>, <b>EnterpriseDB</b>  and <b>SAP Sybase ASE</b> . <br><br>
                    There’s also a number of other popular databases including MySQL, NoSQL and PostgreSQL. <br><br>
                    There are a wide variety of frameworks and languages used to code the application, such as Ruby on Rails, Java, <b>C++</b>/<b>C</b>/<b>C#</b> , <b>Python</b> and <b>PHP</b> . <br><br>
                    Over the last several years Backend-as-a-Service (<b>BaaS</b>) providers have been maturing into a viable alternative. <br><br>

            <h1>  What is Full-Stack Development? </h1>
                <p>
                    The development of both the back- and front-end systems has become so specialized, it’s most common for a developer to specialize in only one. <br><br>
                    As a general rule, full-stack development by a single programmer isn’t a practical solution.<br><br>
                    - However, at times a custom software development company will have developers who are proficient with both sides, known as a <b>Full Stack Developer</b> .<br><br>
                    - They powerful team players because they have the breadth of knowledge to see the big picture, letting them suggest ways to optimize the process or remove roadblocks that might be slowing down the system. <br><br>
